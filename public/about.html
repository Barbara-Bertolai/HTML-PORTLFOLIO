<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Barbara, and I am an ADS (Systems Analysis and Development) student living in Brazil, in the countryside of São Paulo. I am passionate about technology and constantly seek to improve my knowledge in the IT field. Living in a quieter city has helped me stay focused on my goals and studies.</p>

<p>I love traveling and discovering new places and cultures. In my free time, I enjoy reading suspense books and watching romantic movies, which help me relax and inspire me. These interests reflect my curiosity about people, stories, and the world around me.</p>

<p>My dream is to build a solid career in Information Technology, grow professionally, and gain experience in the field. I want a career that allows me to travel, work with technology, and explore different countries while continuing to learn and evolve both personally and professionally.</p>
